# 12-Month-AI-Journey

I am documenting my journey from being a care worker in the UK to becoming an AI/ML engineer and entrepreneur in 12 months.

## Why this repo exists

- To track my daily and weekly learning.
- To store my Python, AI, and data projects.
- To show my progress publicly to future employers and collaborators.
- To keep myself accountable.

## My starting point

- Background: BSc in Chemistry
- Current job: Care assistant (4 x 12-hour shifts per week)
- Coding level: Complete beginner
- Tools I’m using: DeepLearning.AI courses, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub

## High-level roadmap

- Month 1–2: Python fundamentals and basic AI projects
- Month 3–5: Classical machine learning projects
- Month 6–8: Deep learning and computer vision/NLP experiments
- Month 9–10: Data engineering basics (pipelines, SQL, warehouses)
- Month 11–12: Capstone project + job/startup preparation

## How I will use this repo

- `projects/` – real-world projects with their own folders and READMEs
- `courses/` – notes and exercises from courses I complete
- `notes/` – personal notes and ideas
- `content/` – YouTube scripts, ideas, and planning
- `trackers/` – study logs, habits, and progress tracking

This repo is not perfect. It’s proof that I am showing up.
